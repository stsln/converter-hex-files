# HEX file tools

Designed to read, edit and combine multiple hex files into one.

Developed with Python 3.10 and PySide6 (Qt 6).
An annotation of types has been made.

  (to make the file the main one, right-click on it)
* add region - adds a new hex region to the main hex file
* delete - deletes the selected hex regions
* in hex - exports the selected regions to a hex file
* in bin - exports the selected regions to a bin file
* merge - merges all the added files into one (Start Linear Address Record is not added)
* save - saves the modified hex region
